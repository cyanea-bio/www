We're excited to introduce Cyanea, a modern bioinformatics platform designed for today's research teams.

## Why We Built Cyanea

Managing genomic data has never been more challenging. Datasets are growing exponentially, teams are becoming more distributed, and the pressure to deliver results faster is constant.

Existing tools weren't keeping up. We saw researchers struggling with:

- Slow data processing pipelines
- Fragmented collaboration tools
- Complex infrastructure management
- Security and compliance concerns

We knew there had to be a better way.

## What Makes Cyanea Different

**Performance first.** We built Cyanea's core processing engine in Rust, delivering speeds that traditional tools can't match.

**Designed for teams.** Share datasets, collaborate on analyses, and manage access all in one place.

**Modern architecture.** Built on Phoenix/Elixir for reliability at scale, with real-time updates and seamless integrations.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We're actively developing new features based on feedback from our early users:

- Advanced visualization tools
- Expanded file format support
- Enhanced collaboration features
- More integration options

We'd love to hear from you. [Get in touch](/contact) to share your thoughts or request early access.

Welcome to the future of bioinformatics.
