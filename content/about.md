## Our Mission

Cyanea exists to accelerate scientific discovery by making genomic data management simple, fast, and collaborative.

We believe that researchers should spend their time on science, not wrestling with data infrastructure. That's why we built Cyanea: a modern platform that handles the complexity so you can focus on what matters.

## Our Story

Founded by researchers who experienced firsthand the challenges of managing large-scale genomic data, Cyanea was born from the frustration of outdated tools and fragmented workflows.

We set out to build the platform we wished existed: fast, intuitive, and designed for modern research teams.

## Our Values

**Speed matters.** In research, time is everything. We obsess over performance so you get results faster.

**Collaboration is key.** Science advances through sharing. We build tools that make collaboration frictionless.

**Security is non-negotiable.** We treat your data with the same care you do.

**Simplicity wins.** Powerful doesn't have to mean complicated.
